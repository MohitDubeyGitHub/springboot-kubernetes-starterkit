In this project I'm demonstrating the most interesting features of Kubernetes with Spring Boot for building two tier architecture that is deployed on Kubernetes. All the samples may be easily deployed on local Kubernetes single-node cluster.
  
## Getting Started  
Here you will find a simple spring boot application with a simple model and we will be covering implementation and deployment using Kurbernetes, To know more about Kubernetes, You cover inside the my [Hello-k8s](https://github.com/exceptionalcode/hello-k8s) Kubernetes learning kit.
Here in this starter kit you will be introduced to list below :
* A simple spring boot application with a basic model structure performing a CRUD operation. The example is available in the branch master.
* An introduction to Kubernetes with spring boot project, that shows its the most interesting features like Spring Boot, MySql property sources based on ConfigMap and Secret. 
* Using Spring Boot to monitor Spring Boot applications running on Kubernetes using external endpoint exposed by load balancer.
